# Securing Contact-tracing in Covid-19 Related Applications

## Abstract
From the emergence of Covid-19, the primary focus of governments across the world is contact
tracing of the effected person. To achieve this, most of the governments use smartphone data to track
where people go and with whom they interact. In this regard, Government of India is also using ‘Arogya
Setu App’ successfully. These so-called contact-tracing apps help public health officials get ahead of the
spread of Covid-19. However, the downside is the inherent loss of privacy. If abused, raw location data of
a person could reveal sensitive information related to that person using the app. Therefore, this work
proposes to develop a lightweight cryptographic algorithm such that sensitive location data can be
securely transferred to the destination without being compromised.

## Expected Outcome 
Light weight cryptographic algorithm to secure location data which can preferably
work with ‘Arogya Setu App.’

## Expected Timeline
6-8 Weeks
